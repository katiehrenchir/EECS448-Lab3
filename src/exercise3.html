<h1> Spot - Data's Cat </h1>
<h3> (text from Wikipedia) </h3>
<p>
Spot is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)">Data's</a> pet cat and a recurring character in the show. Spot appears in several episodes during TNG's last four seasons, as well as in the feature films Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: Nemesis. She first appears in the episode "Data's Day". <br>

Despite her name, Spot is not actually patterned with spots. Spot originally appears as a male Somali cat, but later appears as a female orange tabby cat, eventually giving birth to kittens . <br>

Data creates several hundred food supplement variations for Spot and composes the poem "Ode to Spot" in the cat's honor. A computer error which occurs later in the series causes some of the ship's food replicators to create only Spot's supplements and replaces portions of a play with the ode's text. <br>

In "Genesis", the morphogenetic virus <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Barclay's_Protomorphosis_Syndrome"> "Barclay's protomorphosis disease"</a> temporarily mutates Spot into an iguana-like reptile. Spot's kittens are not affected, leading to the discovery of the mechanism and a cure for the virus. <br>

Spot is notoriously unfriendly to most people other than Data. Commander William Riker once received serious scratches while trying to feed Spot. Geordi La Forge borrowed her to experience taking care of a cat, but she knocked over a vase and teapot and damaged his furniture. When Data asked Worf to take care of Spot, Worf proved to be allergic to her and sneezed in her face, angering her. However, she did get along with Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, so when Data had to leave on a mission at the same time Spot's kittens were due, he persuaded Barclay to take care of her. <br>
